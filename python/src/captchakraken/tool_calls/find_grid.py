# =============================================================================
# Grid detection: adaptive consistent-color line tracer.
#
# Detects 3x3 / 4x4 captcha grids of ANY uniform separator colour and small tilt
# by tracing each gutter pixel-by-pixel (consistent-colour walk + perpendicular
# slant re-find), clustering duplicate traces, then forming an evenly-spaced
# lattice. The decisive false-positive gate is CELL DIVERGENCE: a real grid's
# cells are filled with content distinct from the gutter colour, whereas a flat
# region (white wall, sky, watermark haze) has "cells" the same colour as its
# "gutters". Ported from the grid_tracer dev harness; see that harness + the
# project memory note `project_find_grid_tracer_*` for the iteration history.
#
# SECOND CUE — the colour comb (_comb_lines) + the seal test (_seal_fraction).
# The tracer is a LOCAL walk, so it fails on the one board captcha vendors draw
# often: a gutter whose neighbours are nearly its own colour. It cannot tell the
# two apart pixel by pixel, every neighbour seeds a trace of its own, and the
# cluster average lands off the separator. The comb asks the complementary GLOBAL
# question — is this whole straight line the gutter colour, end to end? — and the
# seal asks it of a candidate LATTICE: does every separator run the full width of
# the grid it implies, so the cells are closed boxes and the rectangle really does
# repeat? That is positive, content-independent proof of a grid, which is what
# lets the content gates stand down (SEALED_DIVERGE_TOL) on a 4x4 of open sky
# whose tiles are photographs of nothing. Both only ever look for a colour the
# TRACER already proved is painted here, so neither can conjure a lattice out of a
# flat image. Measured over the 1423 real grid captures: 15 misses -> 3, with
# end-to-end false positives (find_grid + solver._is_real_grid) 23 -> 16.

# own colour: every near-colour row seeds a trace of its own, _merge_lines clusters
# the whole neighbourhood together, and the 2px painted line is averaged away by the
# hundreds of pixels either side of it. Measured on recaptcha_1775818840074_rrv7m (a
# 4x4 over open sky): pure-white gutters at x=103/200/297 came back as 66/96/215, and
# no lattice was recoverable from them. hCaptcha's white-background artwork tiles fail
# the same way on the other axis.
#
# The comb is the complementary GLOBAL test — is this whole straight line the gutter
# colour, end to end? — which a near-colour neighbour fails outright at COMB_TOL even
# though the local walk cannot tell the two apart. It is the "grid-like section
# repeated" cue: the lattice is found from the REPETITION of whole matching lines
# rather than from any one of them being individually traceable.
#
# The safety property is that the comb only ever looks for a colour the TRACER ALREADY
# PROVED is painted in this image — a clean, uniform line it walked itself — so it
# cannot conjure a lattice out of an image with no painted line at all, and everything
# it proposes still faces every existing structural, colour and content gate.
